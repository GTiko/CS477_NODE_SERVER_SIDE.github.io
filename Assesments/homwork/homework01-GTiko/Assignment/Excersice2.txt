1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?

setImmediate schedules a function to run in the next iteration of the event loop,
immediately after the current operation completes. whereas setTimeout schedules 
a function to run after a certain amount of time has passed.

setImmediate is that it can help improve the responsiveness of an application 
by allowing other operations to complete before executing the delayed code. 
This can help prevent the application from becoming unresponsive or "blocking" 
while waiting for the delayed code to run.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?

process.nextTick is used to schedule a callback function to be executed 
immediately after the current operation completes and before the event loop 
continues.

setImmediate is used to schedule a callback function to be executed in the next 
iteration of the event loop, after I/O events have been processed.
