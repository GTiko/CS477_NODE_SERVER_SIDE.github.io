1. What is the advantage of the modern web architecture?

Modern web architecture provides advantages such as scalability, 
flexibility, security, portability, performance, accessibility, and 
interoperability. It allows for building web applications that can 
handle large amounts of traffic and data, be modified quickly and easily, 
and protect against cyber attacks. It also ensures fast response times for
 users and accessibility for users with disabilities.



2. Why do we need to use the asynchronous functions?

Asynchronous functions are important because they allow non-blocking 
I/O operations, improving the performance and responsiveness of web 
applications. This allows the application to execute other tasks while 
waiting for I/O operations to complete. By using asynchronous functions, 
the code can be written in a more efficient and readable way.
